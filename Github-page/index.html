        <h2>Core Sub-systems</h2>
        <p>Our engine comprises several core sub-systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rendering System</li>
            <p>The rendering system is responsible for generating the visual output of the game. It handles rendering 3D models, textures, lighting effects, and shaders to create the graphics displayed on the screen. The goal is to produce realistic and visually appealing scenes.</p>

            <li>Physics System</li>
            <p>The physics system simulates physical interactions within the game world. It manages collision detection and response, object movements, gravity, and other forces. This subsystem ensures that in-game objects behave realistically and interact with each other according to the laws of physics.</p>

            <li>Input Handling System</li>
            <p>The input handling system captures and processes user input from various devices, such as keyboards, mice, game controllers, and touchscreens. It translates input events into actions that can be used to control the game, such as moving characters, triggering abilities, or navigating menus.</p>

            <li>Audio System</li>
            <p>The audio system manages the playback and manipulation of audio assets in the game. It includes functionalities for playing background music, triggering sound effects, and handling spatial audio to create an immersive auditory experience for the player.</p>

            <li>Resource Management System</li>
            <p>The resource management system is responsible for loading, unloading, and managing game assets. It handles textures, models, audio files, and other resources efficiently, ensuring that only the necessary assets are loaded into memory at any given time to optimize performance.</p>
        </ul>
