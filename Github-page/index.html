    <section id="core-sub-systems">
        <h2>Core Sub-systems</h2>
        <p>Our engine comprises several core sub-systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rendering System</li>
            <p>The rendering system is responsible for generating the visual output of the game. It handles rendering 3D models, textures, lighting effects, and shaders to create the graphics displayed on the screen. The goal is to produce realistic and visually appealing scenes.</p>

            <li>Physics System</li>
            <p>The physics system simulates physical interactions within the game world. It manages collision detection and response, object movements, gravity, and other forces. This subsystem ensures that in-game objects behave realistically and interact with each other according to the laws of physics.</p>

            <li>Input Handling System</li>
            <p>The input handling system captures and processes user input from various devices, such as keyboards, mice, game controllers, and touchscreens. It translates input events into actions that can be used to control the game, such as moving characters, triggering abilities, or navigating menus.</p>

            <li>Resource Management System</li>
            <p>The resource management system is responsible for loading, unloading, and managing game assets. It handles textures, models, audio files, and other resources efficiently, ensuring that only the necessary assets are loaded into memory at any given time to optimize performance.</p>

            <li>ImGui</li>
            <p>ImGui, or Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface, is a GUI system that allows developers to create in-game user interfaces. It provides a simple way to create and customize UI elements, such as buttons, sliders, and text boxes, to enhance the user experience during development and debugging.</p>

            <li>Texture Handling</li>
            <p>The texture handling subsystem manages the loading, manipulation, and rendering of textures in the game. It handles tasks such as loading image files, applying textures to 3D models, and managing texture resources efficiently for optimal performance.</p>

            	<li>Scene Loading (GameObjects and Components)</li>
            	<p>The scene loading subsystem is responsible for loading and initializing game scenes. It manages the instantiation of GameObjects and their associated Components, setting up the initial state of the game world based on predefined scene configurations.</p>

            	<li>Hierarchy</li>
            	<p>The hierarchy subsystem provides a structured view of the game objects in the scene. It allows developers to organize and manage the relationships between different game objects, making it easier to navigate and manipulate the game hierarchy during development.</p>

            <li>Camera Movement</li>
            <p>The camera movement subsystem controls the movement and behavior of the in-game camera. It allows players and developers to navigate and explore the game world from different perspectives, enhancing the overall gaming experience and facilitating scene composition.</p>

            	<li>Optimization</li>
            	<p>The optimization subsystem focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of the game engine. It includes techniques such as code optimization, rendering optimization, and resource management to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay even on lower-end hardware.</p>

            	<li>Time Management</li>
            	<p>The time management subsystem is responsible for managing and controlling the flow of time within the game. It ensures consistent frame rates, handles animations, and provides a reliable mechanism for measuring and controlling time-based events.</p>

            	<li>Mouse Picking</li>
            	<p>The mouse picking subsystem allows the selection of game objects in the 3D world using the mouse cursor. It involves techniques to cast rays from the mouse position and determine which object or point in the scene the cursor is interacting with.</p>

            <li>High Level System</li>
            <p>The high-level system encompasses various features and functionalities that operate at a higher level of abstraction. This may include systems related to game logic, artificial intelligence, scripting, and other high-level components that contribute to the overall gameplay experience.</p>
        </ul>
